Microsoft just released two tutorials which show how to create simple games in Unity. The tutorials include a lot of pictures illustrating all of the topics, and links to source files.

[The first](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/246495/Sponsored_A_Flappy_Bird_clone_in_Unity_source_code_provided.php) shows how to create a Flappy Bird clone, and delves into topics like procedural generation, sprite sheet management, keeping track of a player score, and rigidbody movement.

[The Second](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/246373/Sponsored_Creating_a_simple_picture_puzzle_in_Unity_source_code_included.php) goes over creating a picture puzzle game. It includes information on managing arrays of assets, working with textures, and managing game state.
